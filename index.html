              React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and
              open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user
              interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta
              (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and
              companies. React can be used as a base in the development of
              single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only
              concerned with state management and rendering that state to the
              DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
              additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side
              functionality.

              PostgreSQL also known as Postgres, is a free and open&#45;source
              relational database management system &#40;RDBMS&#41; emphasizing
              extensibility and SQL compliance. It was originally named
              POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres
              database developed at the University of California, Berkeley. In
              1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support
              for SQL. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to
              keep the name PostgreSQL and the alias Postgres.
            </p>
            <p>
              PostgreSQL features transactions with Atomicity, Consistency,
              Isolation, Durability &#40;ACID&#41; properties, automatically
              updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and
              stored procedures. It is designed to handle a range of workloads,
              from single machines to data warehouses or Web services with many
              concurrent users.

              JavaScript is often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that
              is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside
              HTML and CSS. Over 97&#37; of websites use JavaScript on the
              client side for web page behavior, often incorporating
              third&#45;party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated
              JavaScript engine to execute the code on users&#39; devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a high&#45;level, often just&#45;in&#45;time
              compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has
              dynamic typing, prototype&#45;based object&#45;orientation, and
              first&#45;class functions. It is multi&#45;paradigm, supporting
              event&#45;driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
              It has application programming interfaces &#40;APIs&#41; for
              working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data

              HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting
              content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last major HTML
              version that is a World Wide Web Consortium &#40;W3C&#41;
              recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML
              Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application
              Technology Working Group &#40;WHATWG&#41;, a consortium of the
              major browser vendors &#40;Apple, Google, Mozilla, and

              HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more
              interoperable implementations; it extends, improves, and
              rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces
              markup and application programming interfaces &#40;APIs&#41; for
              complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a
              candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it
              includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

            <p>
              Cascading Style Sheets &#40;CSS&#41; is a style sheet language
              used for describing the presentation of a document written in a
              markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of
              the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and
              content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can
              improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
              control in the specification of presentation characteristics;
              enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
              relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
              repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to
              be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
              share the file and its formatting.
